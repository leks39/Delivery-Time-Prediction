# Delivery-Time-Prediction
Over the last couple of years, food delivery has become a norm in peopleâ€™s lives and this behaviour became even more prominent with the 2020 pandemic. More and more people began to order takeout food online or via phone calls rather than taking trips to the restaurant for pick up. This phenomenon has led to the rise of third-party delivery apps like UberEats, GrubHub, Deliveroo, and JustEat, to mention a few valued in the billions of dollars. Restaurants have also focused on improving their delivery capacity in recent times because it serves as an extra boost to sales by as much as 30% in a very competitive market.

The key metric in determining successful food delivery is **TIME** as delivery minutes directly impact customer satisfaction, food quality and food safety. This project focuses on predicting delivery time and identifying the key features that determine it based on the dataset analyzed.
